# What is this?
## In short

This is just a, very very . . . simple C++ and CMake testing application

I have created this repo as a scratch pad for learning and doing experiments about C++ and it's related tool sets. I have pointed to some of the articles that i found very useful in my learning process.

So if you are also new to CPP and in the early stage of the language learning, You might find my findings and code useful.

I'm just trying to organize the learning materials and code in one place, so that if i need to recall something I could always come here and check.

# Experiments
